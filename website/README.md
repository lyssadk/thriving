# Thriving Cells REPO WIP

This is a website for my mom's business. The goal? To save her time, duh. I created a email scraper using the GMAIL API that will read her emails and scrape any receipts it finds. Currently I'm working with her on the design and making it look prettier. She is also doing taxes right now so she is writing down additional features she would like. Once we finalize the UX/UI things and she is done, I will continue upgrading it. This also has the endpoints for her inventory, dashboard stats, etc. Still a work in progress but it's coming along! Great learning experience.

## Technologies:
* Bun
* NextJS
* Javascript
* Typescript (minimal, very minimalðŸ˜…)
* Vercel's Postgres DB
* GMAIL's API



To install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

To run:

```bash
bun run index.js
```

This project was created using `bun init` in bun v1.1.34. [Bun](https://bun.sh) is a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime.
